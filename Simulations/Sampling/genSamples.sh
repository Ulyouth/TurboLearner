# DESC:   A script to generate sCO2 case samples using OpenFOAM for
#         varying Myong-Kasagi model coefficients. The coefficients
#         at the moment are: A*, Cd
#
#         Note: Bash's basic calculator "bc" was used since native bash
#         scripts do not support floating point calculations.
#
# USAGE:  genSamples.sh [CSV] [CASE] [YPLUSM] [PRTM] [PRT]
#         Where:
#         CSV     is a .csv file containing a description of the
#                 coefficients to be sampled. Syntax below.
#         CASE    is a folder containing the OpenFOAM code template
#                 for the case to be sampled.
#         YPLUSM  is the y+ model to be used:
#                 0=normal, 1=semi-local-scaling, 2=Wallin&Johannson
#         PRTM    is the Prandtl model to be use:
#                 0=constant, 1=Bae, 2=oos, 3=Tien, 4=TWL
#         PRT     is the turbulent Prandtl number.
#
#         Example: ./genSamples.sh coeffs.csv 42F 2 4 0.85
#
#         The syntax of the CSV file is [a b c d e f]. 
#         Where:
#         a is the name of the coefficient.
#         b is the initial value.
#         c is the final value.
#         d is the step.
#         e is to toggle activation. (0=inactive; 1=active)
#         f is a placeholder for the simulation loop. 
#           Must be the same as 'a'.
